## Migration Guide

For the `flightMode` to `autonomyMode` rename:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update SDK Calls" icon="code">
    Replace old parameter usage in your code.
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
    ````javascript
    // Old (v1.0.x)
    await drone.takeoff({ flightMode: 'autonomous' });
    
    // New (v1.1+)
    await drone.takeoff({ autonomyMode: 'autonomous' });
    ````
    ````python
    # Old (v1.0.x)
    drone.takeoff(flight_mode='autonomous')
    
    # New (v1.1+)
    drone.takeoff(autonomy_mode='autonomous')
    ````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Integration" icon="play-circle">
    Run a test flight in simulation mode at `https://dashboard.example.com/simulator`.
  </Step>
